Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Labs is a browser-based interface for interactive computing. Jupyter Labs has support for over 100 programming languages, 
including those popular in Data Science such R, Julia, Scala - and most importantly, Python. Individual notebooks are composable, 
executable, and sharable documents that mix text, code, data, and visualizations. Jupyter Labs comes pre-loaded in Anaconda.

Windows Setup:
Python
Download and install Anaconda. Very specifically download the graphical installer for the 3.7 version
Use all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check Make Anaconda the default Python.


Mac OS X Installation
Download and install Anaconda. Very specifically download the graphical installer for the 3.7 version.
Use all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check Make Anaconda the default Python.

Linux:
We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer Anaconda. (Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't comfortable 
doing the installation yourself just download the installer and we'll help you at the Workshop.)

Download the installer that matches your operating system and save it in your home folder.
Open a terminal window.
Type "bash Anaconda-"
and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down arrow to move down 
through the text. Type yes and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the files. 
Type yes and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your PATH (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
